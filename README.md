**ABSTRACT:**  

This project concerns with Emergency Monitoring System. Which can be implemented on major cities of nepal. Saving peoples live is the most important in today’s world. The best way to save lives is to have an ambulance system and rescue system which is effective and can be reachable to the user/client, this paper gives the solution which focus to make the ambulance, rescue team available to a nearby user/client/patient in the least possible time which will help save many lives. After extensive study and analysis new technology evolved. Mobile applications, system application (Server), Internet and Mobile phone is used. This will help the ambulance location to be updated in the database so that it can be seen by the user who is using this application and makes it easy for him to book the nearby ambulance. The client’s location will be pin pointed on the map and even the ambulance which is nearby the user will be pin pointed on the map, once the patient is on board the ambulance location is taken and information about nearby available ambulance displayed on screen by clicking on it. Nearby ambulance can lock the location which is visible to others. Mobile application can be accessed with the help of internet and SMS system for offline services.

# <a name="_gjdgxs"></a>Introduction
In Nepal, Even after having number of hospitals and health service providers, peoples are still losing their lives due to lack of proper communication between service providers and public. As we moved further into 21<sup>st</sup>​ century we continue to develop the technologies but the technologies are not being used for providing proper facilities to the general public. Public health is very precious, so there is need for the instant response and rescue. 

This project is designed to provide quick and accessible health services to general public. We can use easily available devices like mobile to overcome this problem. With this project, we can reduce the communication gap between general public, ambulance service and the hospitals. Hence, all these sectors can be brought in single framework. Helping hands can be increased for incident. We can easily estimate the time required for the ambulance to arrive in spot, from which affected persons can prepare themselves until rescue team or ambulance arrives.  

















# <a name="_30j0zll"></a>Project Outline 
Two android applications will have developed. One for ambulance or emergency service providers and one for general public with easy interface. Open source data will be used for the project. One system application will be developed that will act as server for the GPS devices. Simple android mobile, tablets can be used as GPS devices. Application will use internet service and will be available in offline mode too. SMS service will be used to send location of public in offline mode to server database. All the ambulance and rescue teams connected with server will get alert and nearby ambulance and rescue team can contact the public which is visible to others too. Public can also contact nearby ambulance and rescue team with the information which can be displayed on application with the simple touch in icon.

# <a name="_1fob9te"></a>Methodology: 
` `The methodology which will be used to carrying out the project will be as follows. 

1. Open data sources will be used like (Open street map). 
1. Global positioning system satellite USA will be used, which is openly available for everyone. 
1. Android devices will be used to collect data in field. (like emergency service provider details, location etc.) 
1. Two real time android application will be developed using suitable developing platform like android studio. One for emergency service provider, and one for public. 
1. A system application will be developed to linkup all GPS device in framework which will act as server for all these devices. 
1. Reliable internet service will be used for these devices.  
1. An easy interface, simple language will be used in application so that everyone can use and understand the motive of this project.  
1. After completion of project, Tablets or any standard GPS supported smartphones with android software will be attached to every emergency service provider’s vehicle or station with reliable internet availability. (for eg: WiMAX could be used in real field for internet) 
1. System application will be installed on Host computer from which all database can be managed. Host computer can be placed in any places inside valley (we can place in Municipality office, Computer for normal use can handle system application, i.e. Great specification is not required) 
1. Mobile application will be available for everyone which can be run on any android devices with any android versions. 





# <a name="_3znysh7"></a>Application of Project: 
1. It strongly supports the vision of smart city.** 
1. Ambulance service will be quick and responsive.** 
1. It can also be used to regulate other emergency services like Fire brigade.** 
1. It can also be used to provide proper response to natural calamities like Earthquake, landslide, flood.**

# <a name="_2et92p0"></a>Project Summary: 
After completion of this project the great changes in health sector may arise. With low budget and available resources, we can easily bring revolution in Health sector. The way of providing ambulance services and rescue services will completely change.
